# Non compatible

_**Is it compatible with plugin X?**_

I can't answer surely to this question because I can't know how every plugin in the world is coded, but here is a list of plugins that can cause problems:

* All plugins that uses **custom resourcepacks** \(you can make them compatible if you've a minimum knowledge on how to merge resourcepacks manually, be sure to not replace ItemsAdder files and you're done\)
* [CraftEnhance](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/custom-recipes-and-crafting-craftenhance.65058/), this plugin messes up ItemsAdder custom recipes logic and creates duplication bugs. So please don't use it
* Plugins that customize crafting table behaviour and recipes
* [LootChest ](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/lootchest.61564/)can cause some [problems](https://github.com/LoneDev6/ItemsAdder/issues/15#issuecomment-512990849)
