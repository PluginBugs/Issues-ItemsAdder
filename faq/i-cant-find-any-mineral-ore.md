# Je ne trouve aucun minéral/ou bloc de minerais

## Common causes of this can be:

* you are searching ores in a **pregenerated world**. Ores will spawn only on new generated chunks \(generated after ItemsAdder installation\). In future updates I will add an option to generate ores also on pregenerated chunks \(example: WorldBorder\).
* you are searching ores around **spawn location**. Please try to **teleport far** from **spawn**
* you are searching ores in a world with custom name. You have to add the world name in the file: `plugins\ItemsAdder\data\items_packs\itemsadder\blocks.yml` for **each ore**
