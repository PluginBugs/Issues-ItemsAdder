{% hint style="warning" %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you place normal water \(or if it's naturally generated\) on the top or on the bottom of a custom liquid you will see it will have the custom liquid color. 

### **This is a Minecraft bug I cannot fix.**

{% hint style="warning" %}
Custom liquids are not totally colored sometimes, some parts still have vanilla water color.
