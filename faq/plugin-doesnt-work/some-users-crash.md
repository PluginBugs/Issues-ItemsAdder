# ☠️Some users crash \(old\)

{% hint style="success" %}
This problem was fixed long time ago, if you still have this problem probably it's a bug introduced again by Mojang
{% endhint %}

If some of your users crash it's because of a Minecraft bug which is really deep inside game logic.  
Problem is that some Intel HD Graphics cards have a driver bug that cause game to crash if custom fonts are included in the resourcepack.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only way to fix this is to disable [custom font](../../plugin-usage/adding-content/custom-fonts/) functionality of the plugin..  
Yes I know it's a shame but I can't do much, it's Mojang fault.  
  
You can read about that here: [https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-176595](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-176595)
