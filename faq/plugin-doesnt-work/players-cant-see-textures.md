# 👁Players can't see textures

#### _My players can't see textures! But I've followed the whole tutorial_ <a id="my-players-cant-see-textures-but-ive-followed-the-whole-tutorial"></a>

There are three ways to fix this issue:

* If your players can't see the new items just link them this simple screens to fix it! [http://imgur.com/a/SG0AU](http://imgur.com/a/SG0AU)​
* If you still have problems delete the server from your servers list, add it again and then enable resource packs.
* If you still have problems leave the server, go to **%appdata%/.minecraft/server-resource-packs** and **delete everything**. Then join the server again.
