# 😄Using font\_images/emojis everywhere

It's very easy, you will be able to use emojis everywhere! For example in [holograms](../compatibility-with-other-plugins/compatible/holographic-displays.md).

### How to do it?

**UPDATE ITEMSADDER TO VERSION 2.1.21 OR MORE RECENT**

* Download [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/)

Now you can use font\_images \(emojis\) everywhere in other plugins easily! \(they must support PlaceholderAPI\).  
This is the code: `%img_NAME%` instead of NAME write the font\_image name.  
For example: `%img_smile%`
