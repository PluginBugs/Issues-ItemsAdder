# Namespace

## Namespace

As you surely noticed ItemsAdder uses **namespaces** to identify most of the things it manages.  
A **namespace** is like a **group** of elements you the plugin can easly understand where a particular item, sound, blocks.. comes from.

### Example

All magic items are under the **realcraft** namespace, so when you use the `/iaget` command you can see all items IDs start with `realcraft:`

## How can I define my own namespace?

Surely now that you see how it works you want to ask me this question.  
To define your own namespace \(you can also define multiple ones!\) it's really easy:
