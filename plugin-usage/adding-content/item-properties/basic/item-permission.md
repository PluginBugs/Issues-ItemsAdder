# Item Permission

### Example

```yaml
permission: myitem
```

To allow your players to **craft** this item you have to give them permission: `ia.user.craft.myitem`  
To allow your players to **see** this item in `/ia` GUI you have to give them permission: `ia.user.ia.myitem`

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember to give them permission `ia.user.ia` to let them use `/ia` command
{% endhint %}
